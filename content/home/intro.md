At Inspired Freediving, our approach to education and skill development is based on three pillars of development:
1. safety
2. relaxation
4. fun!

We support our students in reaching their freediving goals---whatever they may be---using patience, persistence, and an energetic growth mindset.
We have years of instructional experience and bring knowledge from a lifetime watermanship.

We also aim to perform at our optimum, which has seen Inspired Freediving instructors and assistants competing at the National level for Pool competitions and at the Pan-Pacific Pool Championships.
